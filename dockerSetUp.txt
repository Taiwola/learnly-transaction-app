This is a basic docker deployment for nest js app

- in the docker file contains the instruction to  build an image of node:20 and above
- then we build our image using this instruction example 
- docker build -t <app name>;
- once the image has been built, we can push it to our local repository 
- or it can be pull from my local repository docker push seunola/learnly-app:latest
- then to run it, we could use dockercompose and run docker-compose up -d this in our cli
- or we could use this instruction to run our application 
- docker run -e MONGO_URL=mongodb://172.17.0.2:27017 -p 3000:3000 <app name>
